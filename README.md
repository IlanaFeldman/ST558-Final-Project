# ST558-Final-Project

The goal of this project is to create a Shiny app that can explore and model the data I have chosen. This README.md file contains the following:  

  1. A brief description of the app and its purpose  
  2. A list of packages needed to run the app (Incomplete)  
  3. A line of code that will install all the packages needed (Incomplete)  
  4. The shiny::runGitHub() code that can be copied and pasted into RStudio to run the app.  

## Description

This app is intended to be an exploratory app, which allows the user to easily and quickly work with the given online shopper data, which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset). This includes summarization, modeling, predicting, and, of course, viewing the data.
